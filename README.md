# UMD Smith OCS: Data-Driven Optimization of Student Engagement in Career Services

This project was developed as part of the **BUMK744: Marketing Research and Analytics** course at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business. It presents a structured, research-driven approach to optimizing student response rates for career services internship and placement surveys using behavioral insights and incentive testing.

## 🧠 Project Overview

**Business Problem:**  
The Office of Career Services (OCS) at UMD faces low response rates from undergraduate students regarding internship and full-time placement surveys. This impacts the ability to support student career outcomes effectively.

**Research Objective:**  
Identify which factors—student characteristics, exposure to OCS, or incentive offers—increase survey completion rates.

## 📝 Survey Design

The survey was developed in **Qualtrics XM** and covered the following key areas:

1. **Screener Questions:** Ensuring only current Smith undergraduate students participated.
2. **Student Characteristics:** Academic year, major, employment status.
3. **OCS Exposure:** Awareness and engagement with the OCS survey.
4. **Incentives & Motivation:** Likelihood to respond with/without raffle prizes and preferred reward types (via point allocation).

Sample questions include:
- "Have you received the OCS Internship Survey this year?"
- "How likely are you to complete the OCS survey with a potential raffle prize?"
- "Allocate 10 points across potential rewards to indicate which motivates you most."
